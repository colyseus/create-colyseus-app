### Fixed tick + client prediction

The room advances on `setFixedTimestep()`: a framework-owned accumulator runs
`step()` a whole number of times per frame, each advancing exactly `1/TICK_RATE`
seconds. A constant `dt` is what makes the client able to replay the same steps
— with `setTimestep()`'s measured delta it could not.

`defineInput(MoveInput, …)` gives each client a server-side input buffer.
`sanitize` clamps every field as it arrives, because nothing off the wire is
trustworthy. The input schema is deliberately flat and carries no `seq`, no `dt`
and no timestamp: the engine's own counter is the sequence, one input advances
exactly one step, and the SDK stamps lag-comp timing on the wire envelope.

`{{app-prefix}}src/shared/movement.ts` holds the one function both sides run. It is typed
structurally so the same code steps a server Schema instance and the client
reconciler's plain predicted copy, and it is pure — no clocks, no randomness, no
reads outside its arguments. Keep it that way, or prediction and server will
disagree.

To add client-side prediction, see the client wiring in `{{app-prefix}}src/client/` (generated
when the Vite layout is chosen) or the netcode guide:
