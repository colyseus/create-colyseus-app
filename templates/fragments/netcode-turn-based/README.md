### Turn-based

`MyRoom` owns the turn order: `state.currentTurn` names whose turn it is, and a
`play` message from anyone else is ignored. The room locks once it is full, and
each turn carries a deadline — a `clock.setTimeout` skips a player who runs out
the clock, so one idle client cannot stall the match.

`state.turnDeadline` is stamped from `this.clock.currentTime`, the room's own
clock, so a reconnecting client can render the remaining time without the server
sending a countdown.
